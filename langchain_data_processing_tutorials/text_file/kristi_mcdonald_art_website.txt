Behind The Artist
Kristi McDonald, originally from Thamesville, Ontario, Canada, graduated with a BA from Brock University. She is a professional artist who works primarily in drawing and painting mediums such as graphite, ink, oil, watercolor, and acrylic.
Her interests lie within figurative subject matter. After spending some time exploring non-representational experimental art she has recently spent more time exploring natural themes, with a focus on plants, animals, and landscapes primarily through the use of watercolor and oil painting.
Professional Qualifications
She has been in several group and juried exhibitions and has received several academic and non-academic awards for recognition of her work. She contributed to a large number of private collections across Ontario.
Her work was selected in 2015 for an international show curated by Janet Werner named "From Likeness to Fiction" which directly explored the contemporary portrait.
During her final year of post-secondary education she put together a solo exhibition that focused on the relationship between representational and non-representational subject matter, often juxtaposing these themes in her work in order to further explore their relationship.
Recent Focus
Over the past few years since founding Coastal Ink Studios she has been increasingly focused on creating custom commissions and curated oil landscape collections. She has also become an active participant in local industry shows, enhancing the approachability of the pieces she creates for Coastal Ink Studios.
She is currently working and residing in Kitchener Ontario, Canada.

Kristi McDonald - Head Artist
My name is Kristi McDonald and I'm an independent Canadian artist with an honors degree in Visual Arts from Brock University. Art has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember.
It has always been my dream to devote myself to art full time and my shop Coastal Ink Studios is how I’m turning that dream into a reality, so thanks for checking out my work!
One of my goals is to make high quality art accessible to all. That’s why Coastal Ink Studios is a place that everyone will be able to find high quality, affordable art of various styles and subjects.
In our shop you can find archival prints and high quality postcards featuring reproductions of my artwork, or you can shop for an original piece. I have invested in quality tools (like our Epson P8000 printer) in order to ensure the highest quality reproduction can be provided at an affordable cost.
I can't wait to create and share more of my work with you.

Oliver - Head of Security / Model
I am a dachshund and Kristi is my human. While I may be tiny, I make up for it with my ferocity and my very loud bark. I 'help' my mum make the art and sometimes act as her muse, allowing her to paint my magnificent form. I also defend Coastal Ink Studios against any and all intruders!
“Duganne” - Epson P8000 Printer Extraordinaire
At Coastal Ink Studios we strive to ensure all of our Giclée art print and postcard reproductions are of the highest quality. To achieve this we invested in an Epson P8000 Surecolour printer that ensures our archival quality prints that can retain their vibrant colour for a lifetime of enjoyment.
High quality Hahnemühle Photo Rag paper is always selected for the printing process and all reproductions are personally checked by me before being hand cut and packaged to perfection. For our postcards we use Epson Ultrachrome HD pigment inks and Hot Press Natural Paper.

TRANQUILITY FOR YOUR HOME
A SERIES OF DELICATE, SUN-SOAKED OIL LANDSCAPE PAINTINGS INSPIRED BY THE WEST COAST, EXPLORING THEMES OF NOSTALGIA, TRANQUILITY, AND LIGHT.
VIEW THE PAINTINGS 
wanderlust CONTINUES
In December 2021, I left the place I called home for more than six years. With that move came a lot of change, some that was unsettling. Everything felt so different; in good ways and some not-so-good ways. 
In January, I started unpacking my studio, tired from the laborious task of moving house. By the end of the month, I finally was ready to begin painting again. I thought it would be difficult to pick up the paintbrush and create again in this new, unfamiliar space. What surprised me was not only how easy it was but also how much I needed it to feel like my whole self again.
While there were things that felt different, there were also things that felt the same; Like the familiar weight of a paintbrush in my hands, the colours mixing on my palette, or the little notes I scribbled in my journals. I often reflected on when I was creating The Wanderlust Collection. There was so much left unsaid. 
I kept thinking,
What if the story wasn’t over?
A new collection started forming in the studio. 
My hands started working in old familiar ways,
my inspiration drawn to the stories left untold. 
What I thought had been the end of my journey in creating The Wanderlust Collection, really only was the beginning of a new chapter; A series of work that would ground me in the familiar during a time I was feeling very unfamiliar. Through that desire and willingness for my inspiration to guide me, 
Wanderlust II was created.

THE WANDERLUST COLLECTION
Purchase your artwork 
A PEACEFUL escape for your home.
A COLLECTION OF DELICATE, SUN-SOAKED LANDSCAPES INSPIRED BY NOSTALGIA OF PAST ADVENTURES ONCE LIVED.
Explore the collection 
I can remember it all.
Magic. Adventure.
A COLLECTION years in the making
In 2017 I went on an adventure to California that changed my life. That trip made a lasting impression. It inspired me to return to my passion and pursue a career as an artist. 

Four years later, in the middle of a global pandemic and a time of personal unrest, I decided to dust off the photographs from my trip and relive those memories in paint. The past year has been a very turbulent season in my life. A time where nothing felt certain. I needed an escape. 

This collection was fuelled by my nostalgia for the adventures of my past. I always knew I would create this collection. It was never a question of “if”, but more a question of “when”. 

The time was now. A time where I needed escape, peace, and hope. I had to turn inwards. Four years later, The Wanderlust Collection was born.
EXPLORE THE PAINTINGS 
If I had one word to describe how I felt, 
it would be peace. 

Something, it turns out, 
I hadn’t felt in a long time. 

Remember the feeling?
Now, hold onto it tight.

You can do anything.
Be anything.

Hope, 
Evermore. 
These paintings are for you,
Your home, and Your heart. 
May they create moments of beauty, 
especially when things feel ugly in the world.

May they inspire creativity and change.

May they bring peace during times of sorrow, 
turbulence, and uncertainty.

May they remind us to hope for better
and truly believe better is coming. 
Like they did for me.
find the perfect piece for your home.
SHOP THE WANDERLUST COLLECTION 
NOTES FROM THE ARTIST
You would think that painting such peaceful, tranquil scenes in dreamy color scapes would mean I was probably off in my own perfect world for the past few months, but that’s not the truth. 

Painting this collection has been healing for me. It was sometimes painful and hard. Through that pain, I was able to create peace and beauty from these moments.

This collection is about seeking hope and peace in our lives always. Remembering the small joys in life. Escaping in beautiful color scapes, scenes of peace, even if it’s just for a moment. 

Hope evermore. 

Thank you so much for your love and endless support for my work. I could not do this without you.

With Love,

Kristi

31 DAYS OF CREATIVITY — 31 MINI PAINTINGS
every Day May
VISIT THE PAINTINGS 
This May (2022), I will be embarking on a new challenge where I will create one mini painting every day for the entire month.
I am calling it Every Day May. 

This challenge is about making creativity a daily practice, prioritizing artistic expression, and creating inspiration on-demand, all while focusing on the enjoyment of the process. Every day in May I will share each daily artwork I create on Instagram. By the end of the month, I will have completed 31 new mini paintings. 
On Tuesday of every week in May 2022, I will release the previous week's artwork.
week four
For the final week, I am continuing to reminisce about my trip to Prince Edward County. From touring wineries to chasing sunsets, this was the perfect way to end Every Day May.
Explore Week four Paintings 
week Three
This week was inspired by our adventures in Prince Edward County.
Explore Week three Paintings 
In September 2020 my husband and I took a trip to Prince Edward County. Traveling during that time was a very different experience, but this brief trip was filled with both adventure and leisure. We went from exploring unique white-sand beaches to driving back roads to wineries. This gorgeous, quaint area will always be a special place for us. If you ever get the chance to visit, do yourself a favor and stop at Slickers for ice cream. It’s my absolute favorite ice cream in the world!

week TWO
Week two is all about my love for Elora, Ontario. While it may be new to my palette, it is not new to my heart.
Explore Week two Paintings 
Elora is a little town in Ontario that my husband and I fell in love with in January 2019. We were newly engaged and looking for a place to host our wedding. We went for a tour at the beautiful Elora Mill and it was love at first sight. It quickly became our favorite place and we still vacation there to this day. 

This week’s paintings are inspired by our many trips to this charming town, all of which hold a special meaning to my family. In many ways, these artworks are my “love letter” to Elora. 
Purchase Your Artwork 
WEEK ONE
This week’s paintings will be focused on my new home, particularly from recent sunset walks and morning daylight views from my bedroom window. 
Explore week one artworks 
Over the past few months, I have been slowly getting to know a new home in a new place. What once was unfamiliar is beginning to feel like home. I have been searching for the beauty in my every day and finding inspiration all around me. I have especially fallen in love with the sunsets and sunrises here, which seem extra grand. To honor this new place, this week’s series of paintings will be focused on my home.

Shop Prints 
From my home to yours
All prints are printed and shipped from my at-home studio in Komoka, Ontario. Created with a professional Epson printer, only the finest quality materials are chosen to produce archival quality reproductions. 
PRINT FAQ
Do you outsource your printing? 
All prints are printed, hand cut, and packaged with care from my home studio in Southern Ontario, Canada.
What is a Giclée Print? 
Giclée is a French word, meaning to spray or squirt. A Giclée Print is referencing the way a reproduction is printed. This particular printing method is when the ink is sprayed to create high-resolution, archival-quality prints. This term is often used in fine art printing practices. 
Are your prints high quality? 
Yes. All reproductions are created with a professional printer using archival quality materials. 
Which size print should I choose? 
Everyone’s needs are a little different, so there’s no one size fits all answer but here are a few things to consider:
1. Measure Your Space 
I can’t stress how important this is. It’s the only way you will be able to visualize the size of the print your space. 
On the fence between two sizes? Size up if you have the space! You won’t regret it. 
2. Consider Your Frame

If you plan to frame your print, make sure to consider the additional size of the frame in your space. You will also want to factor in additional costs to frame.

For example, a large print will require a large frame. Large frames can be expensive and harder to find off-the-shelf. Be mindful of your budget before committing. 
Should I add a white border to my canvas print? 
If you are planning to stretch your canvas print, you will need a white border. You can add this to your order here. 
Do you offer prints for wholesale? 
Yes! I have a line of wholesale prints available to purchase and I would love to work with you. Learn more about how to shop wholesale here. 
I want to buy more than one print. Do you offer discounts on bulk print orders? 
Yes, absolutely! If you are looking to order a large quantity of prints, please contact me to inquire about a bulk discount. 
Are frames included with print orders? 
Frames are not included and must be purchased in addition to a print. We offer custom made-to-order frames which you can purchase here, or you can find a frame elsewhere! 
How do you stretch your own canvas prints? 
I recommend bringing canvas prints to a professional framer to stretch for an effortless experience. 

If you want to DIY: Check out my canvas stretching tutorial on Instagram.
What print sizes do you offer? 
We offer a wide variety of sizes to choose from! The following sizes listed are all of the sizes we carry. Please see the unique product page for available sizes.
Horizontal/Vertical Prints 

Standard Sizes (inches) 5x7, 8x10, 11x14, 16x20, 18x24, 24x30, 30x40, 36x48

FRAMING FAQ
Are your frames locally made? 
Yes! They are locally made by a framer in Ontario, Canada. 
I ordered a frame with my print. How long will it take for my order to ship? 
All frames are custom-made and ordered from a local framing supplier. Due to the custom nature of this product, please allow 2-4 weeks for your order to be shipped. These beautiful frames are 100% worth the wait! 
You don't carry the frame size I need. Can I order a custom frame? 
Yes, we can order custom frame sizes! I would be happy to provide you with a quote. You can request one by contacting me here. 
Can I put my print in a frame without glass? 
Canvas Prints can be framed with or without glass. If you choose to frame without glass, I strongly recommend getting a protective layer of varnish added to your print. You can request to add this to your print order here. 
I want to buy more than one frame. Do you offer discounts on bulk print orders? 
Yes, I do offer a slight discount on bulk frame orders. If you are looking to order a quantity of more than 3 frames, please contact me to inquire about a bulk discount.
Are frames included with print orders? 
Frames are not included and must be purchased in addition to a print. Shop frames here.

IN RETROSPECT, CREATING THE WANDERLUST COLLECTION
This summer was spent painting in dreamy colour scapes — and it was everything. 
By using my photographs from a trip to California in 2017, I created a series of twelve ethereal original oil landscape paintings. This trip changed my life completely and indefinitely. It inspired me in ways I didn’t think were possible at the time. 
Before I even began painting this collection, I imagined all of the delicate colours I would use. Pastels, warm earth tones, blues, pinks, and purples. I collected paint swatches, mixed colours in my sketchbook, and dreamt up all sorts of wonderful combinations. Dreaming about them was one thing, working with them was another. Seeing my inspiration come to life, slowly, one brush stroke at a time.
“If California was the spirit of this collection, then colour would be the heart.” 
It was pivotal in capturing the emotion of these pieces, transcending through time. An intersection of the past and the present. A collection of paintings which are tranquil, light, and ethereal. Using colour purposefully to create a particular mood for each piece was important, rather than rendering a completely accurate representation of life. 
I believe this collection, and my business, came to be through feeding my feeling of Wanderlust in 2017. It’s that feeling of Wanderlust that made me return to my art practice. It made me pursue my career and passion as an artist. It’s what made me decide I needed to revisit the photographs from that trip and create this collection.
I used my old photographs from my trip and digitally altered them as a starting point for each painting. The landscapes have many elements of realism but these paintings are not meant to be replicas of my photographs, but rather an impression of the time, the place, and the feelings from my past.
It’s like looking back on those moments with a lens of nostalgia. A balance between the raw process and expressiveness of the moment, and representational place and subject. Time has passed and these are moments through the lens of my future self. An interpretation of my experiences then, but now. A juxtaposition of the past and present. All of this is a way to express looking back at a moment in time, capturing the feeling in those moments, and interpreting it in a way that feels relevant to me today.
INSPIRED BY NOSTALGIA OF PAST ADVENTURES.
FIND BEAUTY FOR YOUR HOME AND PEACE FOR YOUR SOUL.
DISCOVER THE COLLECTION 
I hope you are able to get lost in the sun-soaked colour scapes of The Wanderlust Collection. 
Thank you for being here, and thank you for believing in me.
With Love,
Kristi

Kristi: Your images are beautiful and timeless. Because I’ve seen the actual paintings in your studio as well as the pictures online, I have been able to visually absorb the glow of the colour scapes and the moods that are represented in oils paints. Travelling with you, your cousins and my sisters on that trip created fond memories and now your paintings have captured part of that experience.
I’d also enjoy seeing more of your sketchbook process online. The small painting sketch is loosely expressive and reminds me of our morning jog on the boardwalk at Cambria.
Lots of 💕 Mom

MY STORY — Coastal Ink Studios

Coastal Ink Studios 
Back Wanderlust II The Wanderlust Collection Every Day May 2020 Originals 
Back Prints Frames 
MY STORY
If you’d asked me years ago, I never thought I had a “story”. 

Stories were ways to tell epic adventures, marvels, and breakthroughs. There were heroes/heroines with monsters that seemed impossible to defeat, but in the end, would come out changed and victorious. Stories are something worth writing about; Made for the movies. 

While real-life stories aren’t always made for the movies, that doesn't mean they won’t mean something to someone. So, here I am writing my story for you. 
Art has been a part of my life for longer than I can remember. I mean this quite literally, I don’t remember a time before I started being creative. My mother is also an artist who taught fine art for more than 35 years. I believe she was, and still is, a large influence on my lifelong passion for art. 
Growing up, art wasn’t just a hobby. It was something I excelled at. Do you know how humans always like to label things? Well, I was the “girl who was good at art”. It quickly became part of my identity. I won prizes in art fairs, displayed my work in art shows throughout high school and university, received many academic awards, scholarships, and community recognition. 

In high school, I knew I wanted to pursue a career where I could be creative. For a time I considered fashion design but when I realized that wouldn’t be as glamorous as I had first envisioned, I considered teaching.

The truth is, I didn’t know what I wanted to be, I just knew I wanted it to involve art. Deep down, I wondered what it would be like to just make paintings for a living. At the time, that wasn’t a valid career option because I didn’t know anyone who did that, so in my mind, that job didn’t even exist. 
Unsure of the exact career path I would take, I decided to study art at Brock University. 
This was a period in my life where I grew my skills as an artist in ways I never thought I could. It challenged me and shook my confidence a bit. Looking back, this was probably very healthy for me–It’s good to be humbled! This time was invaluable and I cultivated relationships with people I still look up to and admire to this very day. I graduated with honours in June 2015. 

After I graduated I went through a period of transition in my life. I officially moved out of my parents’ home and in with my boyfriend (now husband) to our first apartment in Cambridge, Ontario. Not only was I in a new city, but I now had bills to pay. These huge changes had many growing pains and reality checks. Adulting is HARD. 

I believed a myth many of us artists are told. A stereotype that our society perpetuates: The “starving artist” cliché. That if you want to be an artist, you can’t make a comfortable living just by selling your art. 

This belief led me down a path where I ended up working in jobs that were unrelated to my field of expertise. I was so drained by these jobs that I didn’t make any art for almost TWO YEARS. Can you imagine doing something for your whole life, something that was ingrained as part of your identity, and then one day you just stop? To say I felt like a failure is an understatement. 
I know I wasn’t actually a failure. I gained a lot of financial independence in those years. It’s something I had to do to survive. I didn’t see what it was doing to me at the time, but looking back now I can see it was taking a massive toll on my mental health. I wasn’t being fulfilled and was beginning to become resentful and unhappy.
The universe works in mysterious ways. 
When you start listening, the world gives you signs of where you need to go. This might sound woo-woo to you, but I believe the universe brought me back to my greater purpose.

In 2017 I went on a spontaneous family trip to California. While on this trip, something inside of me changed. I was incredibly inspired by the beauty around me. I felt at peace. I realized this was the way I should be feeling in my life. It opened my eyes to the discontentment which was stemming from my work life. 
This is when I realized I needed to get back to what I loved most: Art
In 2018, I took a chance and started my art business. My husband was actually the one who encouraged me to pursue my passion which helped me take a leap of faith. 

I was warmly welcomed into the small business community here in Kitchener/Waterloo and eventually all over Ontario. I also started offering commission work as soon as I launched my business. At the end of 2018, I decided to quit my 9-5 job to pursue my passion full-time. 

My artwork has now been shipped to SEVERAL countries across the world such as Italy, France, The United Kingdom, The United States, Australia, Austria, The Netherlands, and China (just to name a few). It’s amazing when I take a moment and reflect on how much I’ve accomplished.

So yeah…. That little lie that people like to tell about “starving artists” is just that. A lie. I wish I hadn’t listened to those people for so long. I wish I could go back to myself four years ago and say “it’s going to be okay, this won’t last forever”.
I think back now to when I was trying to decide what to do with my life. I’m actually doing it! I’m literally living my dream. I’m glad I didn’t become a teacher or a fashion designer. I’m even happy I went through a period where I didn’t get to make art because it has made me appreciate what I have now even more. I actually experienced what my life would be like without art.
Is it hard sometimes? Yes! 
Is it worth it? Definitely. 
I’m still GROWING and EVOLVING as an artist, as a businesswoman, and as a wife. 

Some people won’t understand when you pursue something unconventional. Some people will try to tell you that you should do something else, or “get a real job”. People will doubt your capabilities. People might even doubt your love for your passion. 

If you love it though, and I mean really love it, find a way to make it work. Prove the doubters wrong. Find people who support your dreams and hold onto them. It’s not always going to be easy. Believe in yourself and keep trying. 

With Love, 

Kristi

Art decor should express who you are and what you love. No one person is the same. Art can transform your space by evoking emotion, mood, representing a time or a place from your past. It’s time to get inspired. Here are 5 different ways to emote with art in your space!
1. SCALE UP
If you have wall room for it, choosing a large piece of art makes a statement that can completely change the way a room feels. 
A large scale abstract painting, like this one featured on Architectural Digest below, makes a huge impact while still harmonizing with the warmer tones in the interior of this room. Even though there are a lot of neutral colours throughout the canvas, the size of the painting creates bold visual interest and elevates the space by creating an inviting, warm feeling. 
Artist’s Tip: If you choose to make room for a larger artwork in your home, we recommend investing in a quality piece that you truly love which harmonizes other elements in your home. Having trouble visualizing? Make sure you measure the space and the artwork ahead of time so you can visualize the true dimensions.

2. EMBRACE SYMMETRY
This is a trend we are seeing more and more lately! Imagine a gallery wall, but make it symmetrical by choosing all of the same frames. In this style of a gallery wall, uniformity is everything. 
Symmetry is a great way to show off a series of photographs or similarly themed paintings or prints. This modern take on a gallery wall would work well for someone who loves the idea of a gallery wall but wants to keep their style feeling contemporary using clean lines. We love these black and white photographs, pictured below, in black frames featured on Dean Arch’s Park House project.
Artist’s Tip: You can also choose to do a diptych or triptych, instead of a full gallery wall, if you prefer a more minimal look.

3. DON’T FORGET YOUR NOOKS
We love a nicely curated corner, especially the underrated shelf. While these smaller areas can be generally overlooked or forgotten, putting a little extra love into these spaces can make a big difference.
We love the way Studio McGee always groups artwork with books, vases, and other artifacts in their shelving designs. It can really transform an otherwise forgotten space into something beautiful and homey. Check out this shot from their Crestview House design for some shelf-decor inspiration. 
Artist’s Tip: These unassuming spaces would be a great place to display precious keepsakes from your past.

4. BECOME A MINIMALIST
When it comes to minimalism, simplicity is everything. 
We love this boho coastal bedroom featured in Adore Magazine. A crisp, white frame lets the minimalist artwork sing. Minimalism works especially well in smaller rooms because you avoid overwhelming the space while letting larger design elements shine. Minimalism never goes out of style.

5. START LAYERING
Who said layering was only for clothes? Joseph Dirand’s understated Paris home from Architectural Digest is getting another callout today (because we loved it that much). We love the layers of different sized frames, painting textures, and colours in their kitchen. This is so moody and we are living for it. 
We are huge fans of this method because it’s stylish and functional all at once. You save time framing, you prevent wall damage, and you are able to swap artworks out easily. Not to mention you also get to enjoy multiple artworks at once, rather than just one. Need we go on? 
We hope this trend is here to stay!

Artist’s Tip: Maybe you love the idea of having a shelf for your art, but you don’t have a built-in marble shelf readily available in your home (Hey, we can relate).
If this sounds like you, we have just the thing! You can learn how to build your own art ledge in this tutorial on the blog chrislovesjulia! We love the way their DIY wooden ledge is displaying all of the art in their modern and cozy living area.

BEHIND OUR PROCESS: PART 1
CULTIVATING INSPIRATION
All artwork must start with an idea which is sparked by inspiration. For me I want inspiration to come naturally and flow freely throughout every single project. 
Inspiration can really come from anything in life. Whether it’s the colours of the sky at dusk, an outfit, textures, evocative lyrics, or even the colour of my morning coffee, inspiration can strike at any moment. I like to call this phenomenon organic inspiration. I often find myself writing down ideas on my phone, or preferably sketching them out in a notebook or sketchbook. Dreaming up ideas has never really been an huge issue for me, it’s more about having enough time to create all of them.
My ideas flow most actively and freely at night and (almost) always when I am in bed. 90% of my great ideas begin this way. If I had to guess why that is, it must be when I am the least distracted with all the muck of everyday life. That’s my best guess anyway, but I’m not a psychologist. This can be a real pain in the butt because I don’t like to have distractions while I am falling asleep. My brain always goes “bam”, and I think of a really incredible, exciting, amazing idea right when I’m cuddled up in the warm blankets almost ready to fall asleep.
I’ve learned to roll with it though and freely write down anything that comes to mind when this phenomenon happens. The faster I can write it down somewhere, the better (the notepad app is my BFF). Truly, the number of times I have written out entire series concepts on my notepad app, or even a physical notebook beside my bed, is absolutely excessive. I’m embarrassed to say that the percentage of these 1AM ideas that have come to fruition is a fraction of the number of ideas floating around on scrap pieces of paper or notebooks around my house. 
All of this talk makes it seem like coming up with concepts and ideas comes so easy to me but that’s not always the case. When I find myself in a restrictive box it can severely hinder my creativity. For example, if I have a launch planned for a specific holiday or time of year I can get a little stuck. It’s times like these where my creativity isn’t naturally inclined towards a specific theme or idea. A series should be cohesive and strategic, and while this unifies the ideas, it can also narrow the possibilities. The worst is when you get tunnel vision on a certain idea that you desperately want to work, but it’s just not right. It can prevent you from seeing the big picture. I hate forcing inspiration but sometimes you have no choice but to try. This is when I turn to my most trusted sources for brainstorming that will surely spark inspiration. 
The internet is my most used resource for inspiration, especially when I am feeling uninspired. This seems like the obvious choice. The internet is vast with never-ending visual and audible content. My preferred method involves searching for images and compiling them into collections or mood boards. With these mood boards, I gather colour palettes, subjects, and textures relating to what I have in mind until it becomes a comprehensive idea that can be turned into a collection. This helps me visualize the big picture of what I want to create which is a sure way to get out of any type of theoretical corner or dry spell. The photograph below is an example of a mood board I quickly pieced together.
When it comes to commissions, which are a huge portion of my work these days, things work a little differently. I always start by asking my clients what type of painting they want, the medium, and the size. One of the most important things required for most of my commissions is source photographs. The majority of my commissions are pet portraits or human portraiture, so good photographs are essential to achieve a likeness to the subject I am painting. At this stage I figure out what the client’s vision is and determine if there are any special requirements or requests that are outside my usual workflow.
Each client’s wants are different; some have more rigid guidelines, while others are a lot more open. Some projects are more involved and require additional planning. When a project is more complex I will create outlines and/or rough drafts of variable compositions to present to the client. This is a great way to help a client visualize the final painting, or help them choose between different source photos, or compositions. No matter what the case may be, I always have the client communicate their preference to ensure we are on the same wavelength. No matter how you frame it, this step is crucial for success.
I have a love-hate relationship with cultivating inspiration. It always happens differently for each project that I work on. When things are flowing, it can be a truly amazing and revitalizing experience. When I’m stuck, it can feel really defeating and monotonous. Luckily, the former is the more common scenario, so I am inclined to love this part a little more than hate (and hate might even be too strong of a word for it). 
Achieving inspiration is the best feeling in the world. I only wish I had the time and bandwidth to bring more of my crazy ideas to life. Time is the real enemy here. 
I hope you guys enjoyed Part 1 of our Behind The Process Series! What are some of your favourite ways to get inspired? Let me know in the comments below!
With Love,
Kristi

7 WAYS TO STYLE YOUR GRAPHIC TEE 
When I envisioned my first clothing collection, I knew I wanted the pieces to be versatile. Before I even started thinking of designs, I was imagining wearing them with different types of outfits in different settings; from the gym to date night and all things in between. A graphic tee can go with so many things, it really feels like the possibilities are endless. I decided to curate 7 different ways that you can style our coastal ink studios apparel. These looks will take you from day to night, and from summer to fall. 
ATHLEISURE
Some of my most-loved and worn pieces in my closet are from my activewear collection. I work out nearly every day, so it makes sense most of my wardrobe is, I hate to admit it, leggings. 
I love wearing my Rainbow World Map Unisex T-Shirt with my favorite pair of leggings. Now that it’s getting a bit chilly outside I’m all about the layering. Throwing an oversized cropped denim jacket on top with running shoes + a baseball cap instantly elevates the look, but keeps it totally casual. 
This is my go-to dressed-down look for when I am running around town doing errands, walking my dog, or towing my butt to and from the gym.
Tip: I like to tie my shirt in a knot in the front/side/back of the which shortens the length and adds structure for a more fitted look. The unisex tees are particularly big and comfy, so they are essentially perfect for this! 
DARING DATE NIGHT
I don’t know about you, but now that we have been staying home more, I miss dressing up. I miss going out on date nights especially this time of year because it’s perfect weather for layering AND you can get away with wearing open-toed shoes still. You just get all the best outfits this time of year! 
I had to dedicate an outfit to all of the lost date nights of 2020. 
There’s something about a graphic tee dressed up with a skirt, or a dress, that really speaks to me. It’s cool, it’s casual but it’s dressy too. This to me is the definition of the perfect day-to-night date outfit. I paired the Lush Lemons Unisex T-Shirt with a cute mini skirt. To finish the look I layered my leather jacket on top and grabbed a flirty heel. The last two are essential; they both made me feel infinitely sexier with minimal effort. 
This look is totally versatile, too. Think: Instead of a skirt, you could throw the tee over a silk slip dress (which are on trend right now) and knot the shirt in the back to crop the length. 
So. Many. Options.
Note: I knotted the shirt in the back to give it a more fitted and cropped look. 
CLASSIC CASUAL
My go-to everyday look is jeans and a tee. This is the most effortless way to wear any of the shirts from our summer collection. Here I am wearing the Peach Palm Unisex Tee tucked into my favorite ripped denim. You can alternate the look with your favorite jeans, shorts, skirts— you name it. 
Complete this look with a pair of white sneakers and it’s perfection! I’ve worn variations of this countless times and it never gets old. A true classic. 
BOHO LAYERS
I love kimonos, especially in the summer and fall. Something about them is so boho and I’m all about that life. I got this adorable pink kimono from ellmairco this spring and sadly have not worn it nearly enough! When I was dreaming up outfits, I knew I had to come up with a way to style it for the shoot. (Also, go check her out because her stuff is seriously incredible)
I got inspired to pairing it with the Pink Cactus Cropped Tank and it turned out to be one of my favorite looks of the bunch. I grabbed these cute brown booties and my favorite hat which really took this boho look to the next level. My boho-chic dreams-come-true! Personally, I think the hat makes the look. I might be a bit biased though because I wore it on my wedding day. 
This is the look I am most excited to wear this season!
OFFICE CHIC
This is for you beautiful and brave folks who are returning to the office (or school, or work, wherever) this fall.
As much as I wish I could take credit for this look, I can’t. My best friend Shelby actually inspired me to recreate this look. She wore it first (and may I add was a total boss in it). She layered the Lush Lemon T-Shirt under a cute blazer with dressy jeans. Did I mention that she received multiple compliments on her shirt throughout the day?
For my take on it, I chose to swap the blazer for my favorite long green trench coat from Aritzia that I bought last fall. I use every excuse I can to wear this jacket; the color is incredible. Talk about the perfect casual Friday outfit! Add a bold lip and you’re golden. 
If it were Shelby styling this, she would probably choose a coral lip with classic gold jewelry. She’s a classy babe! 
TIP: You could opt for trousers or a tailored skirt instead of jeans for a dressier look. There’s a lot of flexibility, so run with it!
THE FAVE
I am such a huge fan of this outfit. It might actually be THE favorite. I could see myself wearing this for so many occasions and outings. Picnics, coffee dates, walks in the park, backyard hangouts with the girls…. all of the things. Not only did I feel stylish, but I was so comfy! I was really feeling it in this outfit.
The look: The Peachy Peony Cropped Tank paired with a cute wool mini skirt, my fave oversized denim jacket, and new white Adidas sneakers. 
AUTUMN HYGGE 
This September hit me hard with the autumn feels. Fall has always been one of my favorite seasons, but this year in particular I got that nostalgic feeling deep in my soul. Fall is simply the best; gorgeous fall leaves, pumpkin spice lattes (yes, I’m that girl and proud of it), rainy days, the best clothes, cozy layers, candles, fall harvest--I could go on…
It’s all Hygge, as they say in Denmark, which I am officially declaring as my new favorite synonym for cozy. I am going to channel my inner Hygge this fall with the Peach Palm T-Shirt tucked into my favorite jeans. I layered this gorgeous new caramel toned cardigan which my husband (ee… loving how that sounds) bought me on our honeymoon from a small Ontario clothing boutique. It was a cute little place in Wellington named Oak Clothing Co and it’s definitely worth the stop if you’re in the area. The brand is Gentle Fawn, which is also Canadian (I love supporting Canadian brands). 
Note: There’s also an incredible Mexican restaurant across the street from the shop which has some of the most delicious tacos ever! 
The cardigan is the coziest and softest piece in my fall wardrobe. I was so excited about it that it became the main inspiration for this entire look. Pairing it all with fall booties and my favorite hat (see look 4 - Boho Layers) and you have the perfect pumpkin picking outfit! 
Thanks for checking this post out, and if you made it this far, congrats! I hope these 7 looks have inspired you to dress up, or dress down, your coastal ink studios apparel. I know I’m SO EXCITED to style more outfits this fall. 
You can find all of the shirts featured for sale in our shop. Limited quantities are available, so be sure to grab one before they’re gone! Tag us, or send us pictures of how you chose to style your new cozy tees! 
With Love,
Kristi

Frame your artwork on a budget — Coastal Ink Studios

FRAMING ON A BUDGET
Have you ever set out to frame an art print, only to find that the frames are actually more expensive than the artwork itself? 
If so, you are not alone! This is actually a very common issue. Here you will find a few tips and tricks to find a frame without breaking the bank. 
1. Don’t frame your print!
That’s right! Seems like it’s too simple of a solution but the truth is, you don’t actually have to frame an art print at all. Who invented the rules for framing artwork anyways? If it’s too expensive to frame, just find a nice shelf space that you can set the print upright on and enjoy! Not only does going sans-frame help you save money, but it also saves you the time and hassle of hanging and leveling a framed work of art. 

Take a look at how Studio McGee styled this artwork without a frame in their Park City Canyons Remodel.

Tips if you choose to go sans-frame: 
Avoid removing the print from protective packaging if you can. 
Do not use pins in any way shape or form (prints and sharp objects don’t mix, unless your goal is to devalue your print). 
Definitely do not use tape or any kind of sticky adhesive directly on the art print to hang it on the wall. 
These are big no-nos if you want your print to last and keep it damage-free! Remember, you bought a high quality fine art print, not a poster. Treat it with a little love and respect and you’ll be able to enjoy its beauty for many years to come. 
2. Shop At The Big Department Stores
It is hard to beat the prices large department stores like Walmart, Homesense and Ikea can offer. If you are looking for a new product without a hefty price tag, this is where you will get the most bang for your buck. You can also get further discounts by keeping an eye on the flyers and shopping for clearance items at these stores. 
In a future blog post we will break down and compare frame quality and variety from a few of our favorite affordable bulk supplier stores here at Coastal Ink Studios.
3. Shop in the clearance section
Who doesn’t love a bargain? If you are worried about the quality of some of the frames from the stores we listed in point # 2, you might want to consider shopping in the sales section at your favorite upscale brand stores instead. Personally, I love good quality products and don’t mind spending a little bit extra if the construction and materials are better quality. While you might need to wait for a good sale, if you want to buy a brand new frame for your new art print, you can often find a great deal in the clearance sections. 
Artist Tip: Another great way to score some savings on your frame is to check if there are floor models available in-store for a solid discount. 
4. Buy Second Hand 
If you are willing to be a little more adventurous, you should consider buying a used frame from your local thrift store! Not only is this an eco-friendly choice, but it’s also an awesome opportunity to find something that is truly unique and a work of art unto itself. 
Note: This is a great way to do a gallery wall with mis-matched frames. Check out this eclectic gallery wall styling from streetfleastyle for inspiration.

Feeling extra creative? Consider taking things a step further and do a little DIY paint job on your vintage thrifted frame to make it look new and modern! I love this tutorial by Bree Larson from Rain and Pine. She made these old, ornate, thrifted frames look modern and fresh with a simple application of white chalk paint.

Tips when buying frames from a thrift store: 
Don’t just shop in the blank frames section, but also take a look to see if there are any already framed works of art too. Chances are you might find something that is one-of-a-kind and you can simply remove the artwork that is in the frame. (My fiance’s brother and his wife did this with several frames from Value Village and saved a bundle while creating some unique displays that they sprinkled throughout their wedding decor.) 
Make sure you take a measuring tape with you and know the size of frame that you are looking for so you don’t end up with a frame that is the wrong size. The sizes may not always be listed on the frame if you are buying it used.
5. Build It Yourself
If you are blessed with handiness (or know someone who is) then building a frame from scratch is one of the coolest approaches you can take, with limitless customization options. Lucky for us, we live in the amazing 21st Century and there is a how-to video for everything these days! Time to hit up Youtube! Not only is this option budget friendly, but you also have the complete freedom to create exactly whatever you can imagine. Plus you get the flexibility to opt for plexiglass instead of regular glass, which is a much more durable alternative. 
In all seriousness, building a frame yourself can be especially economical if you are trying to frame anything 16x20 inches or larger. Unsurprisingly, the bigger the print you have, the harder it can be to find an affordable frame! You just need to buy the materials and account for your time. Make sure to be aware that depending on the materials you use and how confident you are with your building skills, it might actually end up costing you more time than you are willing to spend for something that is ready-made, but it’s hard to put a price on the being able to tell the story of how you made the frame yourself when you are showing your new art print to your friends. 
Artist Tip: When selecting matting (or any materials that are touching the print for that matter) make sure you are always using acid-free everything. This prevents yellowing and aging of the print and materials over time and will keep your print looking as fresh as the day you ordered it from the Coastal Ink Studios shop!
6. Avoid Custom Framing 
While custom framing can be incredibly beautiful, chances are if you are on a tight budget, it’s not going to be a good option for you. With so many other choices out there, you should not ever feel like you have to get something custom framed. 
Sometimes artwork can come in odd sizes which makes it difficult to find a ready-made frame. This is why at Coastal Ink Studios, you will only find the more common sizes used for all of our prints. If you do find yourself with a print that is an odd size, you can consider purchasing a ready-made frame with matting that is smaller than the print. There’s always a way to make ready-made frames work. 
If you are in a situation where you feel you have no other options, you can definitely consider a custom frame but remember, it will come with a high cost. That being said, if you can afford custom framing and you are wanting something that is completely tailored to you, I highly recommend researching local frame shops. Professional frame shops charge what they charge for a reason; they are experts and they are going to do a fantastic job, and you’ll be supporting another kind of local artist at the same time. 
There you have it! There are tons of creative ways to be able to find a frame that can fit your budget. There is no excuse for *not* displaying your beautiful artworks. So what are you waiting for? Lets get framing!
P.S. I love to see people’s creative solutions to framing their artwork, so if you’ve used the tips from today’s post to frame your art, or you have an awesome suggestion that I missed then definitely leave it in the comments section down below for all to admire!
With Love,

"Santa Cruz Blues" A Square Original Oil Landscape Painting
"Santa Cruz Blues" A Square Original Oil Landscape Painting
CA$1,500.00 
“Santa Cruz Blues” was inspired by our whirlwind stay in sunny Santa Cruz, where living felt easy. 

Breakfast and mimosas at Zachary’s. Fresh ceviche on the pier. Movie nights on the beach. Walks to the boardwalk. The best laid back summer days, where the mornings were crisp and the afternoons warm. I loved greeting these palm trees every time I wanted to head to the boardwalk, framed behind them was the wide blue ocean.

If I had to describe Santa Cruz in one word, it would be blue. Not a sad blue, but that perfect, summer day shade of blue that makes you feel alive. 

Carefree.
May this piece radiate happiness, light, and warmth just like a perfect summer day in Santa Cruz.
This painting is one of twelve from “The Wanderlust Collection”. You can learn more about the inspiration behind thee collection here.

"Mercurial Light" A Horizontal Original Oil Landscape Painting
CA$900.00 
“Mercurial Light” was inspired by my adventures in Cambria, deeply rooted in sunset walks along Moonstone Beach.
As I walked along Moonstone Beach on our first night in California, I felt profoundly changed. The cool, foamy waves were crashing into my feet. The sunlight was quickly fading away in the sky. It was nearly dark, the sun just below the horizon. Light is capricious at this hour. 

I watched the waves in repetition. Out and in, out and in. Like a healing symphony. The kind of moment that can change your life.

This was an unpeaceful time in my life, but I didn’t realize it until I was there, staring at the beautiful marvel that is the sea. Where the earth meets the ocean. 

May this painting be a reminder to slow down and be present in our lives and be brave enough to change course.
This painting is one of twelve from “The Wanderlust Collection”. You can learn more about the inspiration behind the collection here.

“Quiet Expanse” is a reflection of my adventures in Cambria, particularly rooted in walks along the Moonstone Beach Boardwalk.

I came upon this quiet outlook a few short steps off of the boardwalk in Cambria. 

In front of me was a vast, bountiful cliff, filled with grassy foliage that danced in the wind. Overlooking was the pacific ocean, perfectly blue. I was awestruck by it’s beauty. 

The distant waves were crashing into the shore, as though it was also living and breathing, just like me. Stretched out in front of me was miles of coastline, beyond what I could even see, delicately fading into the distance.
May this artwork inspire you to expand and dream beyond what you can see.

“July Haze” is inspired by my adventures in Cambria, deeply rooted in my sunset walks along Moonstone Beach.
It was our first night in California. I remember watching the foamy waves rush onto the shore, leaving behind pockets of bubbles that would slowly fade away. The ocean slowly reclaiming what it gave, leaving behind faint watermarks that reflected the pinky-purple-orange sunset. 

Magic hour. 

If the earth can breathe, this is where the lungs would be. 

Inhaling. 
Exhaling. 
Like a meditation. 

This is what peace looks like to me. Something, it turns out, I hadn’t felt in a long time. From that peace, I was able to immerse myself in the beauty around me, surrounded by family members who I love, awakening my lost creativity. 

May this painting be a reminder of nature’s healing power and that peace and inspiration are intertwined.

There’s something about the early hours of the morning. Time moves slower. There is a quietness to the world. I like to call it Magic Hour.

This painting is rooted in one of my most treasured memories from my trip to California. My mom and I got up early for a walk on the boardwalk to watch the sunrise. It was crisp and ocean mist hung heavy in the salty air, delicately fading the long coastline into the distance.

We walked along the boardwalk, soaking in the quiet morning calm, watching the daylight glow arrive and lift the fog away. We watched the ocean waking from slumber. I knew had to capture the feeling of this moment.

“Blushing Beginnings” was inspired by my adventures in Cambria, the first destination and beginning of my trip to California. This just so happened to be the first piece I completed for The Wanderlust Collection.
Rewind four years. It’s July 2017. My mom, two cousins, and aunts are driving down the California coast. After a few hours, we arrived at our first destination. The rural, sleepy, coastal town of Cambria.
I still remember the day vividly. After checking into our hotel room, I rushed down to the beach, camera in tow. The sun was lowering in the sky quickly. The smell of the fresh ocean breeze in the air. There’s something about the ocean breeze... it’s healing.
I watched the sunset over the pacific ocean that night. Watched as the sky and ocean turn into a multitude of pinks, purples, and blues. I still remember the way the light and colour shimmered on the water and the soft swooshing sounds of the sea. A feeling of peace washing over me with each crashing wave. A feeling of endless possibilities.
May this painting be a reminder to fearlessly embrace new beginnings.

“California Crush” is a recollection of my brief adventure to one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever walked; Half Moon Bay, California.

The beach was just out of sight while we parked on the coastal highway. As I made my way over the edge and the beach came into view, I was breathless. There it was. Boundless, gorgeous, and glowing. It must have been low tide because there were pockets of water that reflected the bright, blue sky. Boundless shoreline meeting the wide-open ocean. 

We only were there for a day, but the beautiful vastness of this beach still leaves me breathless.

“Gentle July” was inspired by my adventures in Cambria, deeply rooted in my sunset walks along Moonstone Beach.

It was mid-July when we visited the sleepy coastal town of Cambria. The mornings were misty and cool along the coast. By midday the sun was blazing and warm, but the pacific air still kept me cool, which was unusual to me.
The sunsets were soft and muted by the mist on the ocean so all sorts of pastels would shine back at me on the wet sand.

I had never experienced a July like this before. Beautiful. Gentle. 

May this painting be a gentle reminder to seek beauty in new experiences.

“Blue Summer” is inspired by my adventures in Cambria, particularly by my walks along the Moonstone Beach Boardwalk.

I remember being surprised by how cool it felt in the shade along the coast. Even during peak hours of the day, even when the sun was shining brightly.

“Salt Air” is a recollection of my brief adventure to one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever walked; Half Moon Bay, California.
It was nearly five years ago now, that brief stop at Half Moon Bay, but I still remember the way it felt.
The sky was perfectly blue, and the ocean air was brisk and strong, whipping my hair around my face. I can still see the smiles on our faces and our laughter muted by the wind, while our hats were nearly blown away.
The beach before us expanded along the horizon as though it would never end. Our bare feet in the sand, leaving footprints behind, soon to be washed away by the tide.

A peaceful quietness lingers in the morning mist. The rising sunlight slowly illuminates the horizon, greeting the ocean after it’s slumber. There’s a dreamlike quality to it, the way the sun dances in the morning fog.
Perfect tranquility.

May this painting be a reminder to seek peace in the morning hours before the day awakes.

This painting is one of twelve from the “Wanderlust II” collection. You can learn more about the inspiration behind that collection here.

“Hope Evermore” was inspired by a time of transformation in my past. A time where I was striving for a feeling of peace in my life. Four years later, I began painting this collection, which has turned out to be a very turbulent season in my life. I desired to escape in beautiful colour scapes, scenes of peace, even if it’s just for a moment.
This painting is rooted in one of my most treasured memories from my trip to California. My mom and I got up early for a walk on the boardwalk to watch the sunrise. It was crisp and ocean mist hung heavy in the salty air, delicately fading the long coastline into the distance.
We diverged from the path and made our way down to the water. We approached the edge, the ocean crashing against the rocks, splashing sea spray around us. There in the distance was a tranquil scene of the west coast gently fading into the horizon. 

A feeling of hope arising.

May this painting inspire you to hope evermore.

“Warm Nostalgia” is a reflection of my adventures in Cambria, particularly rooted in walks along the Moonstone Beach Boardwalk.

In front of me was a vast, bountiful cliff, filled with grassy foliage that danced in the wind. Overlooking was the pacific ocean, perfectly blue, and I was awestruck by it’s beauty. 

I took a few step closer to the edge.

Mesmerized by the surf as it formed into lush white caps. The reflection of the light shimmered in the waves, moving effortlessly. The ocean is a power and force to be reckoned with. 

Cambria was one of my favourite destinations. It was quiet and peaceful. It holds a special place in my heart because of it’s profound impact on my life. I will return there again one day. I’m not sure when that will be, so for now, I will look back with warm nostalgia for the adventures I once had.
May this artwork be a quiet and warm light even in darkness.

“Wistful Reflections” is a recollection of my brief adventure to one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever walked; Half Moon Bay, California.
It was nearly five years ago now, that brief stop at Half Moon Bay, but I still remember it so well.
The tide was low and the water had left an imprint on the white-beige sand.
The beach expanded for miles on the coastline, the beautiful ripples echoed across the earth, the sky mirrored like glass in the most perfect shade of blue painted across the ground. Mother Nature is an artist who inspires me most.
This is where the earth meets the sea, two become one. The ocean and shoreline meet, softly leaving an imprint which will soon fade away.
I know my memories will slowly fade with time, just as the wind and sea will wipe away my footprints that once walked there.
May this painting be a reminder to enjoy this life; our time living is short and nothing is permanent.

“Cambria Daylight” is inspired by my adventures in Cambria, particularly by my walks along the Moonstone Beach Boardwalk.

There’s something about the early hours of the morning. Time moves slower. There is a quietness to the world. I like to call it Magic Hour.

This painting is rooted in one of my most treasured memories from my trip to California. My mom and I got up early for a walk on the boardwalk to watch the sunrise. It was crisp and ocean mist hung heavy in the salty air, delicately fading the long coastline into the distance.

We walked along the boardwalk, soaking in the quiet morning calm, watching the daylight glow arrive and lift the fog away. We watched the ocean waking from slumber. I knew had to capture the feeling of this moment.

May this piece inspire moments of calm and peace, just like those quiet mornings in Cambria.

This is a reproduction of an original oil painting which is one of twelve from “The Wanderlust Collection”. You can learn more about the inspiration behind this piece and the collection here.

This evening felt different. It was one of the first where the air didn’t seem so bitter cold. The sunlight was especially beautiful that evening, painting the sky with multiple shades of cool blues, soft oranges and touches of pinks. The moon was out, too. 

You could smell the change in the air. A reminder that warm weather, blooms, and sunshine would be on the way. I kept walking further because I didn’t want it to be over.

I haven’t witnessed the changes of seasons in my new home yet but experiencing them here for the first time was like greeting an old friend.

“The Pursuit of Beauty is Worthwhile” was inspired through discovery and exploration of my new home, particularly from my recent sunset walks.

When I picked up my paintbrush to create this piece, a phrase clearly came into my mind. 

The Pursuit of Beauty is Worthwhile. 

It was the perfect mantra to begin my day. I wanted to write it down immediately, otherwise I knew it would be forgotten. The only thing I had to write on nearby were these two little squares in front of me which were ready to be painted. I knew it meant these two pieces simply belonged together. 

When it came to naming them, they had already named themselves. 
This painting is one of eight from Week 1 of my “Every Day May” painting challenge. You can learn more about the inspiration behind this series here.

“Sunset Gazer” was inspired through discovery and exploration of my new home, particularly from my recent sunset walks.

This one in particular felt different. It was one of the first where the air didn’t seem so bitter cold. The sunlight was especially beautiful that evening, painting the sky with multiple shades of cool blues, soft oranges and touches of pinks. The moon was out, too. You could smell the change in the air. A reminder that warm weather, blooms, and sunshine would be on the way. I kept walking further because I didn’t want it to be over.
